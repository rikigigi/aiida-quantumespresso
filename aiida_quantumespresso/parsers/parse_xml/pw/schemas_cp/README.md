# Note on CP schema

xml schema was wrong till version 6.6, at least. In particular the input section was not present in the xml generated by cp.x.
The schema in this folder is taken from
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QEF/qeschemas/devel_cp/PW_CPV/qes_cp_devel_030920.xsd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QEF/qeschemas/devel_cp/PW_CPV/qes_cp_devel_030920.xsd) that is part of the repository found at
[https://github.com/QEF/qeschemas/tree/devel_cp/PW_CPV](https://github.com/QEF/qeschemas/tree/devel_cp/PW_CPV)
